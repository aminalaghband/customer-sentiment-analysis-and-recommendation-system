## Project Overview
The system will have the following components:

1. Data Collection: Gather customer feedback from various sources.
2. Sentiment Analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of the feedback.
3. Recommendation Engine: Provide actionable recommendations based on the sentiment analysis.
4. Dashboard: A web-based dashboard to visualize the results and recommendations.

The Customer Sentiment Analysis and Recommendation System is a Python-based application designed to help small businesses understand customer sentiment and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and business performance.

data = {
    'feedback': [/* your feedback data */],
    'sentiment': [/* your sentiment labels */]
}

sentiment_analysis = SentimentAnalysis(data)

print("Sentiment Prediction:", sentiment_analysis.predict_sentiment('The service was fantastic!'))
print("Recommendation:", sentiment_analysis.generate_recommendations('The service was fantastic!'))
sentiment_analysis.visualize_sentiment()
```
